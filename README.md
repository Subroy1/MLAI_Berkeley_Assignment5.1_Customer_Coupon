# In-Vehicle Coupon Acceptance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes driver behavior related to in-vehicle coupon recommendations using the UCI “In-Vehicle Coupon Recommendation” dataset. The goal is to understand which factors influence whether a driver accepts or rejects a coupon while driving.

The analysis focuses on behavioral, demographic, and contextual features such as bar-visiting frequency, passenger type, age, income, occupation, and travel conditions.

### Key Findings

## 1. Bar Coupon Acceptance
- Overall acceptance of bar coupons is ~41%.  
- Drivers who frequently visit bars, travel without children, and have non-agricultural occupations are significantly more likely to accept bar coupons (~71%) compared to others (~30%).  
- Age matters: Drivers over 25 who visit bars are more than twice as likely to accept coupons.  
- Passenger type: Traveling alone or with adults increases acceptance likelihood.  
- Income & dining habits: Drivers who visit inexpensive restaurants frequently and earn less than $50K show higher acceptance.

## 2. Takeaway Coupon Behavior
- Takeaway coupons have high acceptance (~72–74%).  
- Even restrictive conditions like traveling with children or longer travel times do not reduce acceptance significantly.  
- Gender plays a modest role: male drivers accept slightly more than female drivers.

## 3. Additional Insights
- Convenience factors such as short travel time and favorable direction support acceptance.  
- Environmental conditions like weather can influence behavior; e.g., rain may discourage drivers from redeeming certain coupons.  
- These findings can inform customer segmentation, helping companies target drivers who are most likely to accept coupons and optimize operational costs.

### Summary Hypothesis
Drivers are most likely to accept coupons when the offer aligns with existing habits, convenience, and lifestyle. Frequent bar-goers, drivers without children, middle-aged adults, and those with active dining patterns are consistently more receptive. Convenience-based coupons, such as takeaway food, are broadly accepted across demographic groups.
